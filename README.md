# Sonata PCB Sources for Development Board

Sonata is a system for evaluating the usage of [CHERIoT Ibex core](https://github.com/microsoft/cheriot-ibex) as a microcontroller for embedded, IoT and Operational Technology applications.
See the main [Sonata System](https://github.com/lowRISC/sonata-system) repository for more information.

This repository contains the source files for the PCB and related information about the development board.

Sonata is part of the [Sunburst Project](https://www.sunburst-project.org) funded by [UKRI](https://www.ukri.org/) / [DSbD](https://www.dsbd.tech/).

## PCB Status

The board is currently UNTESTED. Gerbers are available but not recommended until some smoke tests are done! Expect this to be updated early 2024 with stauts & potentially updated design files once this is done!
